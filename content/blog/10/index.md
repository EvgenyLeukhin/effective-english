## Homework
Dear Olga

I very glad to write this letter and I'll hope you answer me very soon. 

Now I live in Omsk, It's situated in West Siberia near with Kazahstan. We have very sunny and hot summer, sometimes temperature is above 30 degrees. I like ride bicycle or go for a walk in a parks in this weather with my family.
My wife is on vocation now and I'll hope that I take my vocation very soon. We shall want to go to a contryside, maybe in a sanatorium while this weather is still very sunny. 

Sometimes I go to my work by bicycle and I enjoyed it. Now I work on new enterprice project which will last untill autumn,I think. It's complicated, but interesting project.

I really want to learn guitar-playing and signing, recently i bought electric guitar with amplifier. I start practice with books and you-tube videos. Maybe I'll buy some guitar-courses in the Udemy.com or take practice with a teacher.

I wish you good luck and good weekend. See you soon!
