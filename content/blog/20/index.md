## Homework
When I was studing at school I have many school-friends in my life. I get on with most of them. But when I was studing at the University I lose touch with almost of all that school-friends, but I get in touch with many university-friends. Later when I have ended styding in my Univercity I lose touch with that friend again. 
I think,this is very typical story for most people. When some persons have many common things, which unite them, they get in touch, if not - they lose touch and split up.
