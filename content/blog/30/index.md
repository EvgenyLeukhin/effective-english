Речь бывает прямой и косвенной. Прямая - это речь от первого лица.

## Direct speech

Передача чьих-либо слов буквально напрямую, также как это было сказано.

```They said, "We have signed the contract".```

## Reported speech

Передача чьих-либо слов косвенно, посредством "себя", через "репортера".

При этом будет изменяться личное местоимение и время глагола, на "шаг назад" в прошлое.

```They said, (that) they had signed the contract.```
